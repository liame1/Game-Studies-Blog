        <h1> Blog Post 1: Internet Arcade </h1>
        <h2> 1/28/2026</h2>

        <p>
            <h4>
            Adopt a classic arcade game from <a href="https://archive.org/details/internetarcade">https://archive.org/details/internetarcade</a> Links to an external site. 
            the Internet Arcade and play it in a browser. 
            1) Write about your experience playing, what happened during play?
            2) How is it different playing on an emulator vs playing the game on the original hardware or an arcade cabinet? 
            You can talk about browser emulation or anything that you think might be different..
            </h4> 
            Out of all the listed games to choose from, I chose to play Metal slug. 
            It caught my eye because I had seen it previously when the game collaberated with another game I like called 'battle cats'.
            It was difficult to learn what each button did, it took me about 10 minutes just to understand how to start the game. 
            This is beacuase the person who posted the game decided not to list the controls. There was a comment section on the post which I thought might help, but the only info
            it gave was that the 'ctrl' key was how to shoot.
            So I learned the controls the only way I could, which was pressing all the buttons on my keyboard until I knew what each one did. 
            I kept accidentally starting the game in 2 player mode which was annoying. but then found that if I only added 1 credit I could start in single player.
            I have a lot of experience playing video games, so the controls were not to difficult to learn, and I felt that they were not badly assigned.
            If I had the option to customize the keybinds I would have preffered to use 'WASD' movement, and have the jump button binded to 'SPACEBAR'.
            The nice thing about emulators is that they give you unlimited credits. so I could die in the game as many times as I wanted and still continue. 
            However the downside to playing this way, is that with a keyboard I was limited to up, down, left and right aiming controls. 
            This was a real bother because many of the enemys in Metal Slug will be at a spefic angle that you need to aim towards in order to hit them.
            With a joystick in an arcade cabinet I would have been able to precicly aim and hit the enemys.
            I think if I had the joystick I would'nt have died as nearly as many times as I did.

            <p> 
                <b>This is the session report for the game 'I Doubt' which we played 1/30/2026. We tried playing the game '31' 
                after we had finishing, but was only able to play around ~5 minutes.</b>

                <u>PLAYERS</u>
                Mengting Chang (P1)
                Anita Huang (P2)
                Nguyen Nguyen (P3)
                Liam Esler (P4)
                Angel Luong (P5)

                <i>note: It took us a while to figure out how to set up the game on the site, and edit the player names.</i>

                -- Round one 
                -P1 plays 1 Ace (truth)
                -P4 calls cheat, but did not understand that only the next player over (P2 in this case) is allowed to call cheat. P4 reveals the card impulsively proving that P1did in fact play an Ace.
                -P2 plays 1 Two (truth)
                -P3 calls cheat but was wrong, his turn was also skipped this first round by mistake, as we did not clearly understand the rules for this yet. I believe the rules of Uno are what influenced this decision.
                -P4 plays 2 Threes (?)
                -P5 plays 1 Four (?)

                -- Round two
                P1 plays 2 Fives (?)
                P2 plays 1 Six (?)
                P3 plays 1 Seven (truth)
                P4 calls cheat but was wrong
                P4 plays 3 Eights (?)
                P5 plays 1 Nine (truth)

                -- Round three
                P1 calls cheat but was wrong (P5 was offended)
                P1 plays 1 Ten (?)
                P2 plays 2 Jacks (truth) (P4 is saying they have 3 jacks so P3 should call cheat)
                P3 calls cheat but was wrong, providing context that P4 was lying about having 3 Jacks.
                P3 plays 2 Queens (lie)
                P4 calls cheat and was right
                P4 plays 1 King (?)
                P5 plays 1 Ace (?)

                -- Round four
                P1 plays 1 Two (lie)
                P2 calls cheat and was right
                P2 plays 1 Three (truth)
                P3 calls cheat and was wrong
                P3 plays 1 Four (?)
                P4 calls cheat and was right
                P4 plays 2 Fives (?)
                P5 plays 1 Six (?)


                -- Round five
                P1 plays 2 Sevens (?)
                P2 plays 1 Eight (truth)
                P3 calls cheat and was wrong
                P3 plays 1 Nine (?)
                P4 plays 2 Tens (?)
                P5 plays 1 Jack (?)

                -- Round six
                P1 plays 2 Queens (?)
                P2 plays 1 King (?)
                P3 plays 3 Ace (?)
                P4 plays 2 Twos (?)
                P5 plays 1 Three (lie)

                -- Round seven
                P1 calls cheat and was right
                P1 plays 1 Four (?)
                P2 plays 1 Five (?)
                P3 plays 3 Sixs (?)
                P4 plays 1 Seven (?)
                P5 plays 1 Eight (?)

                -- Round eight
                P1 plays 1 Nine (?)
                P2 plays 1 Ten (lie)
                P3 calls cheat and was right
                P3 plays 3 Jacks (?)
                P4 plays 1 Queen (lie)
                P5 calls cheat and was right
                P5 plays 1 King (?)

                -- Round nine
                P1 plays 2 Aces (lie)
                P2 calls cheat and was right
                P2 plays 2 Twos (?)
                P3 plays 1 Three (?)
                P4 plays 3 Fours (?)
                P5 plays 1 Five (?)

                -- Round ten
                P1 plays 1 Six (lie)
                P2 calls cheat and was right
                P2 plays 2 Sevens (?)
                P3 plays 3 Eight (?)
                P4 plays 4 Nines (lie)
                This was a fatal mistake by P4, as he had only four cards in his hand, which was winning. Claiming that he played 4 nines was obviously a lie, the other players demanded P5 call his cheat. 
                P5 calls cheat and was right
                P5 plays 4 Tens (?)

                <u>Session ended early due to class time</u>
                P1 ends with 15 cards
                P2 ends with 7 cards
                P3 ends with 7 cards
                P4 ends with 9 cards
                P5 ends with 10 cards

                Tie between P2 and P3

                <u>Session Report Reflection</u>

                I found this experience of playing ‘I Doubt’ to be really fun. I thought that playing cards through the internet and over a call would make it far less enjoyable, however this was not true. 
                I love the socialness that games create, although I had just met the people I was playing with, we warmed up to one another quickly. I think that when humans collectively participate and focus on a common goal, bonding becomes an inherent quality of the process. 
                The awkwardness when starting the game was charming, the accusations we made against one another was amusing, and our subtle jokes made me laugh. Within half an hour I had already felt like I could play with this group for the rest of the day. 
                I truly believe that games are the best way to create these experiences. Everyone is present, attentive and prepared for an adventure, which is hard to find in other aspects of life.
